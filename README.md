- My first project
- written in 2022 throughout summer holidays
- extremely bad design
- no prior cs education
- uses minimal imports (`random`, as well as basic imaging library)

## Try it out for yourself!

Simply clone the repository and run the creatively named file!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jetzypetz/crazyfloors
python3 'RANDO SCHMANDO.py'

## About the project

At 16 and having never studied computer science, I decided to throw myself in and work it out completely on my own. For a couple months after school I would mess around understanding datatypes, conditionals and loops. Before I was able to say "elif", I was faced with a unnecessarily complicated challenge: We were moving house to an old house that needed serious renovations. For this reason my parents told me we would need to retile everything, and I was allowed to choose the pattern to tile my bedroom floor. Trying out different options with a standard 2x1 tile, I noticed there are really only a couple of ways they can be tiled. I found this pretty boring and was looking for a style I could look at for years without getting bored, and found a random pattern could do the trick; That's How I found out that there is no way of randomly tiling with 2x1 rectangular tiles, it always ends up like a brick wall or snake pattern which are both repeated patterns.

After some haggling, I convinced my artsy minded parents to let me use irregular tiles, cutting the rectangle into a right-angled trapezium. Then I decided to put my newfound minimal coding skills to the test and throughout several months created an extremely naive python code to generate from scratch an image of the random pattern the poor tiler would have to consult to put together my bedroom floor. I hope you enjoy the result.
